 My name is Advay Pakhale and I am 16 years old. My interests include mathematics, computer science and
 physics. The purpose of this blog is to document my thoughts and progress, as well as improve my ability
 to communicate my knowledge to other people. I hope you enjoy reading my blog!

 I'm just a guy writing down stuff when there are too many things in his head.
