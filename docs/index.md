# Hello, I'm Advay!

## About Me

I'm a rising junior at the National University of Singapore, currently reading Mathematics and Computer Science as part of a double-degree programme.

I'm broadly interested in solving fun and interesting problems with a computational flavour, in domains including but not limited to:

* Robotics (Software Engineer at [Bumblebee Autonomous Systems](https://bumblebee.sg/))
* AI/Machine Learning (previously MLE intern at [Pixta Vietnam](https://pixta.vn/), awesome 3 months spent in Vietnam through [NOC](https://enterprise.nus.edu.sg/education-programmes/nus-overseas-colleges/))
* Low-level stuff (not very good at it, trying to get better through stupid projects like [this](https://github.com/advaypakhale/TCPOverPaperAeroplanes))
* Mathematics has my heart <3 (pure and applied, with a bias towards analysis)
